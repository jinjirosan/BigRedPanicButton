# BigRedPanicButton

In the day and age of increasingly agressive people targeting older people at their door for money or stealing their bankcards, I needed a way for my parents to quickly alert me (or the authorities). This where the BigRedPanicButton project came to life.

It is build around the incredibly awesome MKRFox1200 platform which is using the Sigfox Network to relay the 12 byte message. On the Sigfox backend this message is converted into a callback. In the current case it's sending an email which my phone displays a a persistent message on-screen.
